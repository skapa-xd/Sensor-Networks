The goal of this project is to find the Minimum-Energy Data Offloading Path using Dijkstra’s algorithm with a priority queue. We also 
have to find the Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm and vizualize both the implementations.
We successfully have implemented both the requirements.

The program first prompts the user to input details about the Sensor Node Network and checks for feasibilty and connectivity of the network. If either of them is wrong the program asks to enter valid input. After this the user is prompted to select either Dijkstra’s or Prim's Algorithm for getting the results. The program will execute and output the answers in terminal and the visualization in a new window. 

The five different test cases can be found in the "Test_case" folder along with the screenshots of successfull implementation. 

Note: Please follow the instruction in the Program Execution section to 
        ensure program executes successfully

DOWNLOAD ALL DEPENDANCIES FROM REQUIREMENTS.TXT FILE. THESE LIBRARIES ARE REQUIRED FOR EXECUTION.

Program Execution
1. On your terminal, navigate to the folder where the "main.py" program is located 
2. run the following command 
    
    python3 main.py 

Note: if you are using python 2, run `python main.py` instead 

Result 
The program will return the Minimum-Energy Data Offloading Path using Dijkstra’s algorithm or Minimum Spanning Tree found from the Sensor Network along with the visalization.
